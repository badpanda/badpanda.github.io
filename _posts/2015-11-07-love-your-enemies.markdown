'You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.' (NIV, Matthew 5:43-45)

i.
we blindly forgive and forget everything
as though the knives stabbed in our
backs are just child's play.
we wipe the blood off our bodies,
replacing ourselves with a clean slate.
we keep trying to build saints in all of us
to repress the demons that feed
on our consciences. we love our enemies
so much that we become their apologists,
just like that child who thinks that every scar
his father brands on his skin is a sign of affection;
just like that girl who hears 'shut up or i will kill you'
as 'stay with me because i love you'.

ii.
we are born to fight back, to avenge,
to make things right. you are not some
welcome mat placed at the doorstep to be
trampled over. collect the knives that you
have tried to put away and pierce their hearts
ten times harder, because no divine retribution
feels better than the one that you create for yourself.
the rest will call us unforgiving, vindictive, ruthless;
but where are their gods when they need them?
